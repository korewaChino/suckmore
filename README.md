# suckmore
suckless is bad, and here's why:

# Manifesto
suckless is a bad philosophy, and introduces bad coding practices. And this repo is made in protest to it.

## From a packager's viewpoint

- suckless requires you to manually recompile your software to reconfigure it, and various other patches to customize it. This is really bad practice for us packagers. We cannot package your software if you have to recompile all your software manually. For example: dwm requires additional patching for it to be actually functional.

## list of software that actually sucks more
- dwm (unpackagable, inconsistent code, constant patching)
- st
- slock
